                            a. To Provide You With the Services
                            We use your information to provide you the Services. For example, 
                            we use credit card information to complete a transaction or 
                            an address to allow the FoodTribe to fulfill your delivery.

                            the third party providing the information or performing applicable Services. 
                            Your information may be available or provided to third-party service providers

                            b. To Maintain, Improve, and Personalize the Services
                            We use your information for our everyday business operations 
                            such as auditing, administration of the Services, forum management,
                            fulfillment, and analytics. Your information may also be used to improve 
                            the content and/or functionality of the Services. We may use your information 
                            to help us improve offerings for FoodTribe. We also use your information to personalize
                            your experience. For example, we may personalize the content and features you see when 
                            visiting our Services. In addition, we may personalize advertisements, marketing communications,
                            and recommendations to make them more tailored to your interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            c. To Communicate with You
                            We use your information to communicate with you. 
                            For example, we may send you text messages or other 
                            notifications about the status of your orders and deliveries. 
                            We may also contact you with promotional offerings or other 
                            communications that may be of interest to you. If we send you
                            marketing emails about services that may interest you, each email 
                            will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving 
                            future email marketing communications.
                            In the event you contact us, we use certain 
                            information to respond to your questions and 
                            assist you with any issues that may arise in your 
                            use of the Services. If you send text messages to 
                            FoodTribe using the telephone number for that FoodTribe 
                            available on the Services, we may use a third-party service 
                            provider to track and analyze these text messages.
                            We track these text messages for fraud prevention, 
                            to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to enforce 
                            our Terms and Conditions, and for quality and training purposes. 
                            As part of this process, FoodTribe and its service provider will receive 
                            in real time and store data about your text message, including the date and 
                            time of the text message, your phone number, and the content of the text message. 
                            You will not be able to opt out of transactional text messages between you and FoodTribe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            d. For Account and Network Security Purposes
                            We care about keeping you secure and safe while using our Services. 
                            Keeping you safe requires us to process your Personal Information, 
                            such as your device information, activity information and other relevant information. 
                            We use such information to combat spam, malware, malicious activity or security risks;
                            improve and enforce our security measures; and to monitor and verify your identity so that
